## Overview

I wanted to showcase the true value of GenAI applications,
and the best way was to create a chatbot application for the entire conference.

### Idea

Build an application to support event's participants/attendees.

### Business Objective

Increase participants/attendees satisfaction (CSAT = customer satisfaction).

### Requirements

- GUI (graphical interface).
- Conference Knowledge Base.
- Personalization (unique experience for each user).

### GenAI (ML) Objective

Maximize participants/attendees experience.

### Technologies

- Langchain
- Streamlit
- Weaviate
- OpenAI

#### Data Storage

In regard to vector stores, I selected weaviate since they are open source and provide a great free tier.

### Model Selection

I selected OpenAI as the LLM service provider, since they offer a very good price/quality ratio.

- gpt-3.5-turbo
- text-embedding-ada-002

For reference, around 750 words predicted by `gpt-3.5-turbo` costs 0.002 USD.

## Getting Started

### Setup

Create the virtual environment with:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Then, activate it with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Finally, install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Local Usage

To run the streamlit application locally, use:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will automatically open a window in your default web browser.

#### Have fun!
